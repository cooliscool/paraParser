# paraParser

An application to parse and read Paragraphs from any target website. 

A simple Application with HTML and CSS frontend and NodeJS backend. 

Note : edit the server endpoint address where the website is hosted in both front/index.html and back/index.js before deploying 

The application acts as a web crawler which reads content from 'p' and 'pre' tags. 

When hosted in a remote server, it kinda acts as a Proxy which reads Para data from a target.

### What to improve : 
Error handling of the server . Example, the server crashes when a protocol other than 'http' is used. 

Can develop it into a Web Spider -> to extract relevant specified tags/ info from targets. 
 
### Why I made this : 
For fun. Just to keep life happening.
